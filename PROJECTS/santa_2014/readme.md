# Kaggle's Santa competition 2014 #

This folder will look at the (traditional?) Kaggle Santa competition.

At present, the aim is just to understand the problem, and present a little Python code for this purpose.

The "official" Kaggle repository can be found here: https://github.com/noahvanhoucke/HelpingSantasHelpers

The (very large) data files can be downloaded from: http://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers/data

Rules etc. correct as at 9th December (there have been some rule changes, so who knows if there might be further rule changes).
