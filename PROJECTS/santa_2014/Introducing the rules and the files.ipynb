      "   - An elf may work in \"unsanctioned\" time, but this is penalised:\n",
      "      - Once an elf finishes his/her task in unsanctioned time, they must take the same number of minutes off in the next period of sanctioned time.\n",
      "      - For example, working from 14:00 to 19:33 is allowed, but the 33 minutes of unsanctioned time must be repaid, so they elf can only start work again at 09:33.\n",
      "      - An elf with no penalty to pay may start work at any time.  [Discussion that while allowed, this is a silly strategy](http://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers/forums/t/11202/elf-s-working-time)\n",
      "      - This is cumulative, so if an elf works form 9am Monday to 7pm Friday, this is 4*14=56 hours of unsanctioned work, and so the elf spends the next 5 days on holiday, and can only start at 3pm on the 6th day.\n",
      "   - There is some controversy over the boundary case of when andElf comes off a rest period at _exactly_ 19:00. The wording of the problem would suggest that the Elf can work again then, but the sample Python code (which I think is used to validate the results) is complicated.  In particular, it implements a corner case: if the rest period is an exact multiple of 600 (daily sanctioned working minutes) and the start of the rest period is between 19:01 and 9:00 (inclusive) then the elf is next available at 9am the _following_ day.  I think this is a bug, but unfortunately it seems to form the actual rules of the game.  [Forum link](http://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers/forums/t/11158/yet-more-confusion)\n",
      "   - Once an elf starts work on a toy, he/she must complete that work, alone, in one go (hence often necessarily clocking up a lot of unsanctioned working time.  Santa is an interesting employer...)\n",
      "   - Each Elf has a \"productivity rating\" of between 0.25 and 4.0 (64-bit \"double\" floating point value).  All Elves start at 1.0.\n",
      "   - The time it takes an elf to make a toy is `Duration` divided by `Productivity`.  Time is always in full minutes, so round up.  [Forum link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers/forums/t/11093/can-we-get-a-clarification-please/59477)\n",
      "   - The productivity is held constant during the making of a toy.\n",
      "   - At the end of constructing a toy, the productivity is updated as\n",
      "   $$ p_{\\text{new}} = p_{\\text{old}} (1.02)^n (0.9)^m $$\n",
      "   where $n$ is the time, in hours (can be a fraction), of sanctioned work, and $m$ is the time of unsanctioned work.  By \"work\" we mean the actual time taken by that elf to construct the toy (taking account of the elf's current productivity.)  Once applied, we then clamp the value to the interval $[0.25, 4.0]$.\n",
