# Code style, tooling, testing, all that Jazz

Some (slightly [opinionated](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php))
thoughts about coding style, using tools, "getting the machine to help you" and so forth.

These are my own thoughts, and ultimately a lot of "style" issues come down
to personal preference.  I would urge you to _think_ about the choices you make,
and be alert to ways to improve your coding.

- [style](style.md) -- Initial discussion of style issues.
- [tools](tools.md) -- How using programming tools can aid style.
- [testing](testing.md) -- Some thoughts on Unit Testing (in Python).
