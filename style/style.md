# Code style

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) gives the classical definition of code style, which focuses on the

- Layout
- Indentation
- Use of white space

In code.  Python forces some of this upon you (which is a good thing, IMHO).  I want to broaden the discussion to make "code style" more about generally "how you write code".
