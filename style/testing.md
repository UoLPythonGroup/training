# Testing

## Why test

- [Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36274791)  You probably don't want your GP using software with a bug in it.

Closer to academic home:

- [The Reinhart-Rogoff error â€“ or how not to Excel at economics ](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646)
  - A mistake in an excel spreadsheet lead to wrong conclusions in a highly cited ("impactful") work of economics
  - The [academic paper](http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf) which rebutted the work makes excellent reading (and, under my interpretation, the Excel error is perhaps the least of their sins)
  - The [Conversation Article]((https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646) makes an excellent plea for properly [Reproducible Research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/)
  - But that's a rant for another day.

I also want to make that case that testing will:

- Lead you to write better code
- Make it easier to change and update code in the future
- Make it less stressful to develop code
- Ultimately make you more productive, though it may not seem so at the start.
