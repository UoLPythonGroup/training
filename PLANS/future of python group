Python Group Meeting 09/07/14

The following things were discussed regarding the future agendas of the python group.

1) A few meetings should be spent on dealing with pandas and data commands.

2) Some time should be spent on python visualization (in general). 
      How to present a result, that gets most of the information across visually.    
      (“Figure Production”)

3) What about looking at stats/data analysis in a python perspective.

4) Have some more sessions like data hack but make it drop-in sessions.

5) Have some sessions for possible 2nd year students to get them up to a certain
      level in python. 

6) During a session (like data hack) is it good to have a set of machines with
     same software’s so that a program created on one machine runs smoothly on
     the others.
