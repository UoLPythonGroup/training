training
========

Python discussion group module training, ideally organised into folders for different modules.

IPython notebooks in this repository can be viewed online at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/UoLPythonGroup/training/tree/master/
or these days, directly in GitHub (if you get an error, a quick refresh tends to help).
